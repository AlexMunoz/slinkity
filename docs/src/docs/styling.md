You may be used to setting up SCSS compilers or pipelines by hand in 11ty. With Slinkity, we say... no more! Let's learn how to wire up your favor flavor of SCSS using little-to-no config with Vite.

- Load stylesheets
  - Preprocessors
  - PostCSS
- Import styles from JavaScript (ESM)
  - Don't forget `__slinkity.head`

## Load stylesheets

We recommend using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to process all styles in your project. For instance, say our project directory looks like this:

```bash
src/
  index.html
styles/
  global.scss
```

Goal: load `styles/global.scss` into our `index.html`. We can do so using a single `<link>` tag in our document's `<head>`; The same way we'd load any stylesheet on the web üôÉ

```html
<!--src/index.html-->
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/@root/styles/global.scss">
</head>
<body>...</body>
</html>
```

You'll notice 2 interesting pieces here:

1. **We start our `href` with `/@root`.** This is one of several /[import aliases](/docs/import-aliases) we include out of the box with Slinkity. These make importing from directories _outside_ your build output as easy as possible. In this case, we're importing from the `styles` directory at the "root" of our project. See our [import alias docs](/docs/import-aliases) for a full list of preincluded import aliases and ways to add our own
2. **We keep the `.scss` file extension.** As long as Vite understands a file extension you're trying to use (`scss` works out-the-box), it's happy to process that file into something browsers can understand. See Vite's docs on styling for all preprocessors they support, and ways to use your favorite one

As long as you understand import aliases and keep Vite's style configuration docs bookmarked, you're ready to rock with Slinkity üé∏

### Nestsed CSS imports

Say your stylesheet imports a number of extra chunks:

```css
/* styles/global.scss */
@import url('./variables.css')
@import url('./mixins.css')
@import url('./normalize.css')
@import url('./base.css')

...
```

**As long as you're using a relative import path,** these imports will just work ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è! Vite is smart enough to resolve these nested imports and include them in the final build output.

### PostCSS config

Slinkity supports everything Vite supports for PostCSS. You can happily:
- Add a `postcss.config.js` file at the base of your project for Vite to find
- Add extra resources (ex. a `tailwind.config.js`) to extend your config further. Following Tailwind's docs should cover that use case without any trouble, but you can [find a Tailwind + Slinkity example here]() for a copy / paste solution üôÉ
- Install any necessary plugins using a Vite config at the base of your project. [More on config here](/docs/config/#vite's-vite.config.js)


## Dev vs production outputs

You might be wondering: what does Vite _actually do_ with my processed stylesheets when I build my site? This will depend on whether your `--serve`ing or building for production.

### Dev server

If you're using the dev server, all files (styles, scripts, etc) are stored in Vite's internal cache and served on request. This means stylesheets will only be compiled **for the given page you're viewing in your browser.** So:
1. No more waiting on a build process to bundle _every_ stylesheet in your project. It only builds the resources necessary for the page you're viewing.
2. You get hot module reloading (HMR) whenever you edit your stylesheets. This means no more browser refreshes; you'll see your styling changes instantly, while keeping any JavaScript state in tact.

### Production builds

If you're building your site for deployment, all stylesheets will be processed to plain CSS files under Vite's configured assets directory. This is `/assets` by default, but [can be configured via a vite config](/docs/config/#vite's-vite.config.js).

Let's see how a production build may look. For this input:

üìÇ **Input folder structure**

```bash
index.html
styles/
  global.scss
  something-imported-by-global.scss
```

üìÑ **Input `index.html`**

```html
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/@root/styles/global.scss">
</head>
<body>...</body>
</html>
```

You'll get an output similar to this (using default settings):

üìÇ **Output folder structure**

```bash
_site
  assets/
    global-[random-hash].css
  index.html
```

üìÑ **Output `index.html`**

```html
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/global-[random-hash].css">
</head>
<body>...</body>
</html>
```
